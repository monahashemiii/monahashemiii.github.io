    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a postdoctoral researcher at the National University of Singapore (NUS), focusing on hardware security, VLSI design, and dependable computing architectures.
      
      I hold a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Tehran, completed in Jan 2025. My doctoral research centered on hardware security and anti-counterfeit design, specifically developing scalable and reliable logic locking techniques to detect and prevent counterfeit hardware.
      
      During my Ph.D., I was a visiting research scholar at the Computing and Architecture group at NUS, where I gained further experience in secure and efficient computing systems.
